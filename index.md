I am currently a part-time postgraduate research student at the University of Surrey, UK. After obtaining my MPhys in 2021 with a thesis on applying unsupervised machine learning to the study of galaxy spectra, I joined the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP). My research now lies at the intersection of computer vision, graphics, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am interested in learning algorithms that build decomposable, object-centric representations of 3D environments. In addition, I continue to possess a strong interest in data-driven astronomy and maintain collaborative ties in this field.

Alongside my research, I serve as an associate teaching assistant, acting as lead module tutor for several postgraduate courses within the Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI (PAI).
